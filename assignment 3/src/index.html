            <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
            <p>
              The <strong><em>American Bear</em></strong> in adult age, his skull is almost 30 cm,
              the claws are black, gray, or brown, the claws are short and round. The paws, on the
              other side are larger comparing then with the other bears paws apart from the polar
              and brown bears. The ears are small and rounded in the backside of the head. Their
              weight depends mainly on their age, health, sex, and season. For example male's weight
              is much higher than female bears, in autumn their weight is higher than in spring,
              adult bears are heavier than young bears. There are multiple variations of colors,
              their fur is very soft, the color mainly is affected by the location they live:

            <h2>BEHAVIOR</h2>
            <p>
              The <strong><em>American black bears's </em></strong>eyesight and hearing is much
              better what humans have, the smell sense is that strong than is 7 times more sensitive
              than a our dog's sense. These bears can swim very well, they normally swim for food,
              for example hunting for fishes, or for pleasure. On the other side this animal can
              even climb trees, the main reason for climbing trees is normally to hide from enemies,
              for food, or for hibernate. They tend to be territorial, their territories are marked
              by rubbing and clawing against the trees. These bears communicate with each other by
              some vocal sounds and some non-vocal sounds, different type of sounds are made in
              cordial situations, on the other side when they moan or blow air they are nervous or
              angry.

            <h2>ATTACKS</h2>
            <p>
              The american bears throughout the years have always been able to kill humans, but they
              prefer maintaining any type of fight with humans This bears are dangerous but not as
              dangerous as <em>grizzly bears</em>. The black bears does not attack humans normally,
              they mock. American black bears normally don't attack for territory, they normally
              hunt only for food, so for their survival, the worst attack recorded is in
              <time>May 1978</time>, when an American Black Bear attacked 3 youngsters that were
              fishing in <em>Algonquin Park in Canada</em> and got killed on the moment. An other
              attack recorded in <time>August 1997</time> when in
              <em>Liard River Hot Springs Provincial Park in Canada</em> when a black bear attacked
              and killed a child a mother and a man who tried to help, and a the bear was killed
              while he was mauling a fourth person. The American black bear as many other animals
              have been hunted, the first Americans that lived in America started hunting those
              animals, for many <abbr title="Native Americans">NATI</abbr> tribes these bears were
              considered as very intelligent and when they killed those bears they decorated their
              heads because they considered them as very intelligent creature.

            <h2>DIFFERENCES BETWEEN RUSSIAN AND AMERICAN BEARS</h2>
            <h3>Location</h3>
            <dfn>
              in Russia bears mostly live in forest zones of Siberia, specially in the north zone
              where it's colder, in the south side of Russia there aren't many bears because the
              weather and the fauna aren't suitable for them, on the other side the American Bear
              lives mostly in the Alaska zone.
            </dfn>
            <h3>Appearance</h3>
            <dfn>
              in USA their weight can reach 13 feet and they are one of the most aggressive and
              dangerous animals in the world, the main difference is that they have long hair, on
              the other side in Russia the bears have short brown hair, they are much smaller and
              weaker than the north American bears.
            </dfn>
            <h3>Image</h3>
            <dfn>
              The american bears have a very bad image, they attack people, and in the movie
              <cite>The Revenant</cite>, they attacked Leonardo DiCaprio, the russian bears are have
              a very decent image, and they were even the symbol of the
              <q>1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow</q>.
            </dfn>
            <h3>Claws</h3>
            <dfn>
              American bear's claws can be 6 inches long, the russian ones are much shorter, and
              they don't hunt with their claws but with their teeth.
            </dfn>
            <h3>Work out</h3>
            <dfn>
              russian bears can easily climb trees, because their weight is much lower than the
              american bears and their claws are smaller.
            </dfn>
            <h3>Diet</h3>
            <dfn>
              both bears are omnivorous but they prefer eating plants, nuts, and fresh salmon. The
              differences are only the type of plants and fishes available in those certain places.
            </dfn>
            <h3>Tail</h3>
            <dfn> russian bear's tail on average a bit longer than the american bear. </dfn>
